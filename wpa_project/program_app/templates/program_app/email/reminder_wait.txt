Hi,

Either you or a member of your family is on the wait-list for a class on {{ beginner_class.class_date }} You may show up at the range and if there is space we can let you in. Space is not guaranteed, but you will most likely get in.

Please plan to be at the range {{ minutes }} minutes prior to the class to allow us to sign you in. {% if beginner_class.class_type == 'beginner' %} Students that arrive past {{ beginner_class.class_date|time }} will not be allowed to participate. Be sure to bring proof of vaccination or proof of a negative PCR Covid-19 test within the previous 48 hours for yourself and all the members of your party. {% endif %}

If for any reason you can't make it, please cancel your registration by going http://registration/woodleyparkarchers.org/
