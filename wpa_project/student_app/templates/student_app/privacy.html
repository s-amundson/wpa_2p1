    <h4>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing  </h4>
    <p>
        We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.
    </p>

    <h4>Security </h4>
    <p>
        We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.
    </p>
    <p>
        While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
    </p>

    <h4>Updates </h4>
    <p>
        Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and all updates will be posted on this page.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via email.
    </p>
